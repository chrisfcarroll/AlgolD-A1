Merge Sort
    others 
        selection: multi pass, finding min each time
        insertion: lazily keep first n elements sorted
        bubble: swaps
        ... all generally O(n2)
    merge sort

Guiding principles: worst case and asymptotic
Recursion tree method, counting ops done

Merge sort:
    halve the array, sort each half and combine
